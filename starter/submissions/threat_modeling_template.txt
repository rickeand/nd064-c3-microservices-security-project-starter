Docker Threat Modeling

[FAIL] 2.2 Ensure network traffic is restricted between containers on the default bridge (Automated)

- Denial of Service: [FAIL] 5.11 Ensure that CPU priority is set appropriately on container (Automated)
  Solution: use --cpu-shares flag to distribute resources to the containers according to their priority
  Example: docker run --interactive --tty --cpu-shares 512 centos /bin/bash

- Spoofing [FAIL] [FAIL] 4.5 Ensure Content trust for Docker is Enabled (Automated)
  Solution:
  Example:

- Elevation of Privilege [FAIL] 5.25 Ensure that the container is restricted from acquiring additional privileges (Automated)
  Solution: Add 'no-new-privileges' to the security options
  Example: docker run --rm -it --security-opt=no-new-privileges ubuntu bash

Kubernetes Threat Modeling
Given Kubernetes' system components and the STRIDE framework, identify five potential threats that may arise.

Docker-bench Run Results and Analysis
From the failed findings, select and document 3 findings from the Docker-bench results that you want to harden based on the 5 attack surface areas you identified in Step 1. At least 1 of the 3 hardened findings should be different from the ones mentioned in the exercise (i.e. 5.10, 5.14, and 5.22).
