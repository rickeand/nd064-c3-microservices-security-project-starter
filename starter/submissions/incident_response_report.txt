1. Incident commander name:
    Andreas Rickert
2.Executive summary of what happened
    High CPU usage was discovered on 28.10.2023. Three crypto mining pods were discovered on our kubernetes cluster as the reason for this.

3.Summary of what was affected
    The attacker was able to gain access to several nodes in the cluster and use them to run their malicious mining software.
    This resulted in increased resource usage and decreased performance on the affected nodes.

4.Summary of the impact
    The high CPU load resulted in a slow response time of our services running in the cluster.

5.Summary of the remediation steps
    The three pods were removed and the cluster was checked for vulnerablities.
    A CPU limit was put in place to protect the cluster from running out of resources in the future.

6.Summary of lessons learned
    To prevent such attacks in the future the access to the api server was restricted.
    Admission contoller were put in place to prohibit the deployment of unverified images.
